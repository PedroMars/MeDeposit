I won't change the image again, but you don't need the teleport to Varrock anymore, just have the Varrock magnetite added to the skill bar, otherwise the items remain the same, I changed a lot of things and added some checks, I hope this has improved

This script uses

Spectre's quest.lua as lib, to use it import it


I made a small change, in case something happens and you stop in the middle of the mission, now it is possible to select the step you stopped at.

Start the script through PristInPerilUi, if it is from the beginning, just select step 1 and click start
